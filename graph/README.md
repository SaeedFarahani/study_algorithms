**Breadth-first search (BFS)** 

BFS is an algorithm used for tree traversal on graphs or tree data structures. 
BFS can be easily implemented using recursion and data structures like dictionaries and lists.


#Time Complexity

Since all of the nodes and vertices are visited, the time complexity for BFS 
on a graph is O(V + E) where VV is the number of vertices and EE is the number of edges.
